Project Overview
This project analyses household electricity consumption data (2018–2022) and includes:

Data cleaning (handling missing values and outliers)
Descriptive statistics by region
Visualisation of consumption trends and relationships
Predictive modelling using Linear Regression to estimate electricity cost
Files Included
dataset_student (2).csv — Original dataset
dataset_cleaned.csv — Cleaned dataset (after handling NaNs/outliers and recomputing cost)
task1_data_cleaning.py — Task 1: Data cleaning
task2_descriptive_analysis.py — Task 2: Summary statistics + correlation
task3_visualisation.py — Task 3: Trend plots + scatter plot
task4_predictive_model.py — Task 4: Linear regression + evaluation + actual vs predicted plot
How to Run (in order)
Run Task 1 to generate the cleaned dataset:
python task1_data_cleaning.py
Run Task 2 for descriptive analysis:
python task2_descriptive_analysis.py
Run Task 3 to display plots:
python task3_visualisation.py
Run Task 4 for prediction results and plot:
python task4_predictive_model.py
Notes
Missing values are handled using linear interpolation by region over time.
Electricity cost is computed using the tariff rate:
Cost_RM = 0.57 × Consumption_kWh
Model evaluation uses R² and MAE on an 80/20 train-test split.
